# GradleBasics
This repository serves as a demonstration of the basic understanding of Gradle, a popular build automation and dependency management tool. The project showcases how to set up a simple Java project using Gradle, manage dependencies, compile the code, and create executable artifacts. I have also created two simple tests in which one passes, and one fails to demonstrate the uses of gradle tests for debugging, especially on a large codebase.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

    Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
